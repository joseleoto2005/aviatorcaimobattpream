## Aviator Game Guide

**Aviator** is an exciting and fast-paced online game where players

    rises.
3.  **Cash Out**: At any time, you can click the \"Cash Out\" button to

    multiplier, but if you wait too long, the plane may disappear, and
    you lose your bet.

    a new bet after each round and try your luck.
